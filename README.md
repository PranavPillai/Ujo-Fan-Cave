# Ujo-Fan-Cave

A side application of the [Ujo](https://ujomusic.com) platform. The Ujo-Fan-Cave--now referred to as 'The Beat', leverages Ujo's badge smart contract to fan pages for the music groups on its platform. Fan pages allow for real time chat with others who have purchased the same badge, as well as an artist dashboard where the musician can offer his or her super-fans exclusive deals and content.

Register and buy badges on [Ujo dev server](www.dev.ujomusic.com). Be sure to have [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) installed. [Rinkby eth](https://faucet.rinkeby.io) is needed for testing.
